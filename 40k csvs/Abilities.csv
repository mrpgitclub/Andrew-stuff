To do so, select one or more of the dice from your Miracle dice pool, instead of making any or all of those dice rolls. For each individual dice that is being rolled as part of the dice roll, you can select 1 Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool to be substituted in place of that dice. The dice that it is being substituted for is not rolled, and instead the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled. Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice from your Miracle dice pool, and roll any remaining," unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll.

This means that if any <a href=""/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Re-rolls"">re-rolls</a> occur", the number and values of any Miracle dice that have already been substituted in the dice roll remain the same for the re-roll (for example, if a single Miracle dice was used to substitute one of the values of a charge roll, and the charge roll was re-rolled," only the unsubstituted dice can be re-rolled).<br><br><i><b>Example 1:</b> Instead of rolling one D6 to see what value is added to a unit’s Move characteristic when that unit <a href=""/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance"">Advances</a>", you could use a dice from your Miracle dice pool.
